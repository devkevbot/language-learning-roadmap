# Project 2: Guessing Game

This project covers the following topics:

- I/O
- Conditionals
- Looping
- Type Conversions

## Instructions

1. Pick a minimum and maximum integer value such as 1 and 100.
2. Pick an *answer* integer value which is contained within this range. This answer can either be hardcoded, or, better yet, pseudorandomly generated.
3. Continuously ask the user to provide a number via
`stdin`.
4. Parse the user's input and check against the answer:
    1. If the input is larger than the answer, print "Too large!"
    1. If the input is smaller than the answer, print "Too small!"
    1. If the input is equal to the answer, print "You won!" and exit the program
