# Project 4: Naive CSV Parser

This project covers the following topics:

- File I/O
- Loops
- String Manipulation
- Error Handling

## Instructions

A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a type of text file where data fields are delimited by a comma.

A sample CSV file `input.csv` as been provided for this project. The first line of the file is the header row that
defines the names of the CSV columns.

1. Read from the file line-by-line
2. Parse each line into a struct or class whose fields
are associated with the columns of the CSV
3. You don't need to worry about some of the tricker CSV gotchas; the input has been crafted to avoid quoting and spacing issues
