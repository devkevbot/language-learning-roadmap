# Project 3: Fibonacci Sequence

This project covers the following topics:

- Functions
- Recursion
- Conditionals

## Instructions

The [Fibonacci Sequence](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html) is a series of numbers
where each number is generated by adding up the two previous numbers in the sequence.

- Create a function `fibonacci` that takes in an integer argument `n`, the nth Fibonacci number to calculate.
  - For instance, `fibonacci(3)` means to calculate the 3rd Fibonacci number.
- The 0th Fibonacci number is always 0
- The 1st Fibonacci number is always 1

For reference, here's the Fibonacci Sequence up to the 10th number: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55
